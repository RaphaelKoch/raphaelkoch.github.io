<p><strong>Was ist <i>ein</i> Huhn?</strong></p>

<p>If you ever watch photography videos on YouTube you’ve probably stumbled across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/froknowsphoto/videos" target="_blank">Jared Polin</a>. Jared’s channel is an example of many of those you can find on YouTube, in that it’s more about technology than photography.</p>

<p>They’re the modern equivalent to the magazines that used to be popular in the 80s/90s/00s - full of articles on how to use your camera, reviews of new gear, post processing tips, all that kind of stuff. It’s useful, and potentially interesting stuff, and really quite popular, but it’s not really what I would class as “photographic” content.</p>

<p>Jared isn’t alone here - there are literally thousands of these channels on YouTube that have the same type of content. Some channels even started out more photographic but pivoted heavily towards the technology type of content as they realised that’s what most people want. “The Art of Photography”</p>

<p>Because it sells, in terms of views. Massively so in some cases. And that’s because most people who are interested in photography are interested in content about the technology; they buy cameras and lenses and accessories and software, they don’t buy prints or photobooks or visit galleries and exhibitions.</p>

<p>Most photographers aren’t really interested in art either, so they don’t buy it. I mean, how many photographers do you know that have shelves full of photobooks?</p>

<p>Order “The Art of Photography” videos by most popular and you have to scroll a long way beyond the clickbait gear reviews before you get to the (excellent) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGEE7pGLuppS6Wn-FHetQPfo0QbeDiTYe" target="_blank">“The Artist Series”</a> - content that receives one fifth of the views of the technology focussed videos.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Your <i>Audience</i>?</strong></p>

<p>So what happened when Jared decided to create a photobook? That’s somewhat of a pivot in terms of content. Would his audience be the same as those who watch his videos, listen to his podcast, buy his tutorials and plugins? No, I think that’s evident from what I’ve already said. However, Jared’s channel has (as of writing) 1.3million subscribers.</p>

<p>Could he sell a couple of thousand copies to some of those 1.3million subscribers? A couple of thousand copies by any measure is large number for a photobook. For a self published book that figure is enormous.</p>

<p>I think it’s worth pointing out that this appears to be more a project about the making of a high quality photobook rather than the actual subject of the photobook itself. Jared has been drip feeding content on the making of the book for <a href="https://www.berniephotobook.com/info" target="_blank">several months</a>, which reveals some of the thought process, costs, design decisions, and goals.</p>

<p>I found out about this project via Hacker News<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> and spent some time watching Jared’s videos and listening to the podcasts. So, immediately Jared captured at least one more viewer/listener (per video) via a comment on an entirely unrelated source - a lot of projects are discovered this way. Mission accomplished, right? Eh maybe. Let’s go over what went through my head when I watched/listened to the rationale and learned about the project. I jotted down notes here as bullet points, with my thoughts/responses in italics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jared wants to tell a story via photos
    <ul>
      <li>but is adamant on having QR codes from the offset (little to no text)</li>
      <li><em>so it’s telling a story via photos but largely by additional commentary?</em></li>
      <li>would rather listen to the story than read (<em>would he get this far in this blog post?</em>)</li>
      <li>perceives the book as a vehicle for the QR code/commentary/audio story
        <ul>
          <li><em>so from the offset this is not really a <strong>photo</strong>book</em> in the traditional sense?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Was initially aiming more at his YouTube core audience
    <ul>
      <li>wanted a book (or books) of all previous work/photo stores</li>
      <li>the Bernie book idea came later
        <ul>
          <li><em>perhaps the realisation that these videos wouldn’t appeal to the audience of technologists informed that?</em></li>
          <li><em>and that those who might buy the book are less interested in Jared’s work?</em></li>
          <li><em>so something more cohesive, or less about Jared would be a better first book?</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Estimates 1% of viewers (of this series of videos) will buy a book
    <ul>
      <li>25,000 views -&gt; 250 sales
        <ul>
          <li><em>seems like a realistic percentage</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>talks about making a profit (through sales + potentially a sponsor)</li>
      <li>“endgame is selling out the books in the first run”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Chose Bernie as it’s more relevant (or, time sensitive)
    <ul>
      <li>other photo stories/history aren’t time sensitive</li>
      <li>did 3 shoots over 2 days, then</li>
      <li>255 keepers (“best of the best”)
        <ul>
          <li><em>that’s <strong>way</strong> too many keepers for 3 shoots</em></li>
          <li>down to 118 selected for the book (double page spreads), 250ish pages</li>
          <li>cutting out “close to similar images”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>didn’t plan on doing KickStarter initially (“I have a following”)</li>
      <li>knows it’s a divisive project from the offset
        <ul>
          <li><em>that’s not necessarily a bad thing</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>doesn’t want to do a “garbage” book
        <ul>
          <li><em>doesn’t define this, but I suspect he means the cheaper self publishing options on the web</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>“you don’t need a publisher anymore”
    <ul>
      <li><em>ehhh, disagree strongly: a publisher has more marketing clout than even multi-million follower YouTubers will ever have for this niche, and they have the power to get photobooks in front of <strong>the audience that is much more likely to buy them</strong> including into dedicated stores, on stands at photo festivals, submit to awards<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, into magazines, onto websites, etc.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Thinks small books are a “cash grab” (e.g. Martin Schoeller’s recent book?)
    <ul>
      <li>“it’s small, it’s not impressive”
        <ul>
          <li><em>the form of the book is part of the message/story</em></li>
          <li><em>a big ass print of a mediocre photo is still mediocre</em></li>
          <li><em>Bernie’s character doesn’t strike me as grandiose, so why should a photobook on him be?</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>goal is to sell 500 books to listeners/viewers, would be happy to sell 1,000
        <ul>
          <li><em>again, seems reasonable</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>cites the Obama photobook frequently
        <ul>
          <li><em>that’s a <strong>massive</strong> outlier in the photobook world</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>seems to think publishers give cash advances on photobooks
        <ul>
          <li><em>maybe if you’re very well established and large sales are guaranteed</em></li>
          <li><em>as said, that’s rare</em></li>
          <li><em>most publishers will give you a percentage of the print run to sell yourself</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Heavy emphasis on profits: print 2,000 equals more profit
    <ul>
      <li><em>yes, if and only if you sell most of them</em></li>
      <li><em>most photobooks struggle to break even, let alone make a profit</em></li>
      <li><em>many photobooks end up stacked in storage somewhere, or discounted to sell</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>“I hate the gutter”
    <ul>
      <li><em>i think most photographers do initially</em></li>
      <li><em>but then you learn it can be used as a compositional or design device</em></li>
      <li><em>hide things in the gutter, divide a photo into two parts</em></li>
      <li><em>refuses to crop (which is fine) but then struggles with the gutter</em></li>
      <li><em>if you refuse to crop you absolutely don’t have 255 “best of the best”</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“Where am i going to put 13 pallets of books? (weighing 6600kg)”
    <ul>
      <li>still wants a big book</li>
      <li>selling for $60</li>
      <li>decided on ordering 2,000 books (regardless on Kickstarter)</li>
      <li>total (order/expenses) cost: $65,000</li>
      <li>“you absolutely need a designer” (<em>yep, no question</em>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Very much focusing on the book as an object, in terms of size, quality, QR codes
    <ul>
      <li>not so much on the actual photo content?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Artist’s statement (“author statement”)
    <ul>
      <li><em>is more interested in the process than the subject</em></li>
      <li><em>say’s little about the subject/project (Bernie)</em></li>
      <li><em>it’s about the book (as an object), the documentary, the commentary, YouTube</em></li>
      <li>“it’s about the story” <em>of making the book, not the subject of the book</em></li>
      <li><em>this is not a book about Bernie, it’s a book about Jared who happened to be shooting photos of Bernie</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I should reserve any opinion on the actual book until I have seen it, but at $120 (being a EU purchaser) it’s not something I am willing to spend that much on given what I have seen so far - there’s enough here to form an initial set of thoughts…</p>

<p>In general it’s cool to see more of this content on photography channels that are usually more focused on the gear. However, as a photobook this is probably pretty weak. It’s not a compelling project or photobook, nor would the time frame yield enough variety in images to create a strong edit. You need to follow your subject for a much longer time period (months, if not <em>years</em>) to get enough content to make a photobook<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The preview images we see are nothing new, nor are they strong enough to make most people want to see more. The three (?) shoots might yield enough photos to make a good six, twelve, or twenty image editorial piece, but a book? If you were going to create a book from this you might want to play with the form a little and perhaps be a bit more meta in the design.</p>

<p>Although the subject is divisive (just look at some of the comments on the videos), that’s not necessarily a bad thing if you can work around it. I have photobooks on political figures that I abhor<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>, but the books or projects/approach are done brilliantly. The problem in Jared’s project is that there’s too many images, too many of them are (probably?) too similar, and we’ve seen it all before.</p>

<p>Even the “bangers” aren’t that interesting - we’ve seen <a href="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/650/299/d049cb0202cc44fe9aad02b3af6737ed_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1621968045&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=674ef84cb92580b21930811b98005068" target="_blank">these types of photos</a> thousands of times, either contextually within <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=political+rally&amp;client=firefox-b-d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch" target="_blank">the type of photography we see from political rallies</a> or otherwise. So you’re never going to appeal to those who dislike the subject of the book but might be interested in photobooks.</p>

<p>Other problems are that it’s big and expensive even by photobook standards. $60 + $60 to ship outside the US means $120. Jared is losing a large part of his audience that exists outside the US who might have bought the book. The book doesn’t need to be as big as it is, half to two thirds the size (dimensions and number of photos) would have made a much cheaper book to buy and ship.</p>

<p>The QR codes for commentary approach is an interesting one but ultimately a mistake I feel. These will be non-functioning in twenty or even ten years time; the book will be left to stand alone on its photographic content, which <em>most</em> photobooks should anyway, so focus on making the strongest book of photos.</p>

<p>All that said, Jared’s <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jaredpolin/bernie" target="_blank">campaign</a> was successful<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>, more than doubling its (financial) goal. It looks like the number of copies pre-sold will be close to the estimate of 500 and if the book is on Amazon as well it may well sell a few hundred more. It looks like Jared will be close to breaking even, perhaps a small profit.</p>

<p>However, the reality is that if an unknown photographer had created and self published this book they might have sold a dozen copies. Fifty copies if they were very lucky. It really is an editorial piece at most, not a book project. I suspect Jared will still have a few pallets of the book stuck in storage for a while if he has ordered 2,000 books.</p>

<p>This <em>is</em> an outlier. A photographer with an inbuilt audience large enough that the subset of “those who are interested in photobooks” and “those who are interested in the artist/subject/project” created the sales. I suspect the majority are of the latter not the former. Jared will have gained more subscribers and viewers due to the nature of the project (the “making of”) rather than the subject of the project, so I think he/we can say yes: mission accomplished.</p>

<p>So props to Jared for achieving that, all while creating content that is more interesting than the usual content on his channel and being transparent on the process and costs - I’m sure many viewers were shocked to realise how much producing a high quality photobook can cost. This type of content I would consider something a bit more “photographic”, let’s see more of this in future please?</p>

<p><strong>So, Who is <i>My</i> Audience?</strong></p>

<p>I think we’ve established that I don’t know, other than the aforementioned reply of “the photobook crowd”, which is pretty small. Clearly there’s crossover with the audience that follows the subject, an audience of five hundred million fans, but probably not so much. If I can capture one percent of one percent of one percent that’s an entire print run for most small independent photobook publishers. Maybe.</p>
