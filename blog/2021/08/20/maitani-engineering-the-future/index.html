<center><strong><i>Visionary from the beginning</strong></i></center>



<p>In 1954, Maitani was a 21-year-old automotive engineering student at Waseda University, wandering the streets of Tokyo with a Leica IIIf - So engaged with cameras was he, that the young man patented his own camera design before he’d even left the school. In 2002 Yoshihisa Maitani gave an Interview which was later translated in english. In this story I mostly relied on the man himself to tell his part. 
  <br>
  <br>
  His words - like the following - are marked with an "M"
<br>
<br>
  M: <i>"Olympus Optical Co. Ltd. was established in 1919. At the beginning, it mainly manufactured microscopes. Starting from 1936, it involved in camera production. A year later, it became a listed company. The cameras produced at that time were 6x6 cameras; it was not until 1948 that 35mm Leica-alike cameras were made. In 1959, I started designing cameras for Olympus. At the same year, Pen half frame camera was introduced. In 1972, OM System was also released. In addition, our company also manufactured 8mm movie cameras, microcassette tape recorders and laser measuring devices. Camera production amounted to half of our company's total production volume. This is the brief history of Olympus."</i>
<br>
<br>
  Olympus had been manufacturing cameras for only twenty years. The Company needed know-how to grow, and Olympus was actively hunting for young talent in all major Japanese universities. 
<br>
<br>
Then Eiichi Sakurai, himself the creator of the first Olympus camera, stumbled upon Maitani’s camera patent, he insisted that the younger man would start working for Olympus immediately. In a lecture, Maitani related the wrinkle in the story:
<br>
<br>
<i>
M: <i>“In those days a student who refused to work for the first company to offer him a job was regarded as a disgrace to his university. I had received a job offer from an automobile manufacturer, but I pretended that I hadn’t and so went to work for Olympus instead.”</i>
</i>
<br>
<br>
The young designer’s first project was, paradoxically, to design nothing. Instead, he was sent to the Olympus factory for a period of practical training in which he was rotated to a different department every six months. After two years of this front-line training, he returned to the design department and was given a deceptively simple brief.</p>

<center><strong><i>“Try designing something.”</i></strong></center>
<br>
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62988081/132521070-efee9d4a-4199-4265-8bd1-66fb30208532.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
<br>

<p>With this unusual degree of freedom, he set a lofty goal; to design a camera that would cost one quarter the price of the least expensive Olympus camera then in production. </p>
<p>Even at this earliest stage of Maitani’s career, the ideals that would define his product designs were already foremost in his mind. He wasn’t satisfied to simply design a cheap camera. He wanted to design an inexpensive camera that was also made to an incredible level of quality, quality to rival the Leica IIIf of his younger days.

Among his many philosophical design beliefs was the idea that “the lens is the soul of the camera.” 
<br>
<br> 
Maitani knew that the image quality of his Leica began with its Tessar type lens. When he asked the lens designers at Olympus to make a lens as good as his Leica’s lens, without any concern for cost. The result was the D-Zuiko. Creating this stellar lens required that Maitani spend his entire development budget. They had made a beautiful lens, but there was no money left to design the camera. Maitani was back at the drawing board.
<br>
<br>
Over time, Maitani developed a number of prototypes for what would become the Olympus Pen, a sophisticated, half-frame viewfinder camera with an incredibly sharp fixed lens. When he finally brought the camera prototype to Sakurai, the senior man at Olympus immediately decided to manufacture it. Initially outsourcing production to another factory, production was eventually moved to Olympus’ own works when the Pen began to sell. 
<br> 

<center><i>And sell it did.</i></center>


<br>
Within a matter of months the company was producing more than 5,000 cameras per month, and production - in this eraly stage - couldn’t keep up with demand. 
<br>

Maitani had his first hit, so the higher-ups at Olympus gave him just one, simple task;
<br>
<br>
<center><strong><i>“Make new cameras more quickly.”</i></strong></center>
<br>

Over the next handful of years, Maitani and the design team at Olympus would develop a series of Pen derivatives, some easier to use, some with special features. By the end of the Pen’s incredible run, the camera would sell more than 17 million units, an unprecedented number.</p>
<br>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62988081/132520958-5682cc9e-8a5c-4586-b515-a3941b7fed38.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
<br>
In 1963, following the success of the original viewfinder Pen, Maitani and the design team he now lead were tasked with developing a more advanced Pen. 
<br>
<br>
This new Pen was to be an SLR camera with interchangeable lenses and an entire suite of accessories, creating a true system camera to rival the large SLRs of other manufacturers. Incredible technical limitations and many preconceived notions of what makes a quality SLR had to be overcome. Maitani and his team set to work, and the resulting camera, the Pen F, was nothing short of a mechanical masterpiece.
<br>
<br>
Among the countless technological innovations involved in making one of the smallest SLR cameras in the world, was a new rotary shutter system made of titanium. This shutter, capable of speeds up to 1/500th of a second and of syncing with a flash at any shutter speed, took countless iterations to get right. The eventual final design required a technique learned from Olympus’ microscope manufacturing in which the center of the shutter was machined to incredibly thin tolerances while the edges remained thick. A specially strengthened spring made of Swedish steel was required to reach such rapid speeds, and intricate mechanical gears were specially machined to provide low-speed operation.
<br>
<br>
A world’s-first reflex mirror that flipped sideways, and a special prism for directing the light sideways from the lens to the viewfinder all required new ideas and resulted in new patents. Maitani and Olympus had created one of the most advanced and incredible mechanical cameras of all time. But less-than-exceptional sales pointed to the surprising fact that SLR shooters, who were typically more serious about photography, wanted a full-frame 35mm camera and not a half-frame camera. This lesson learned, Maitani’s next project began.
<br>
<br>
When Maitani walked Tokyo's streets people would come up to him and ask for him to autograph their Olympus cameras. The later story is, that he always carried a diamond headed pen in the pocket of his jacket to engrave his initials on the top plates of his fan's cameras. 
<br>
<br>
<center><strong><i>“Form follows function”</i></strong></center>
<br>
<br>
M: <i>"There were complex circumstances behind it. It was not simple (smiling). It began for the US market. In 1967, our main merchandise was the half frame cameras. But in the US, slide film was the mainstream. Half frame doubled the cost of mounting film. In some case, 36 exposures mounted on 35mm slide mounts were returned after development. [Two exposures are mounted on a single slide mount.]
Japanese film processing shops adopted the half frame format at once. But it was not in the US. For this reason, sales department requested the development of full frame 35mm SLR camera."</i>
<br>
<br>
In 1967 Maitani and his team began work to create a full-frame 35mm SLR camera. Though internal forces within Olympus initially deigned to suggest that Olympus’ full-frame SLR could simply be a rebranded product from another manufacturer, Maitani disagreed. He fought for over a year to convince those in the sales and manufacturing departments that Olympus needed to not only build their own full-frame SLR, but to also build a type of SLR that no one had ever built before; a tiny SLR that sacrificed none of the durability or capability of the competition’s bulky and heavy professional SLRs.

<br>
<br>
M: <i> "I did not say "No way!" for answer, but " I never develop [the same camera]." It makes no sense to make the same camera. [What I want is] To say in my own word " To Create Value". That is to create a camera with new value which customers want. At that time SLR had 3 defects: big, heavy and mirror shock. And they were not overcome."</i>
<br>
<br>
Finally, in December of 1967, Maitani received approval from Mr. Sakurai to move forward on his project. Now the hard work would begin.
<br>
<br>
M: <i> "Small and lightweight cannot be expressed in specifications. We had some conferences but specifications were never discussed. I wrote exact copy of the functional values of a camera from another maker on a blackboard for persuasion (smiling). At last, I could persuade the executives in the last conference in 1967, they said, " Do what you want."</i>
<br>
<br>
Maitani instructed his team that he wanted to build an SLR to compete with those made by anyone else in both features and performance. He also demanded that this professional spec camera should be twenty percent smaller in both length and height, and fifty percent lighter than Nikon’s model. His unprecedented design directives didn’t end there. He also required that Olympus’ compact SLR should be capable of 100,000 shutter actuations in a time when the most expensive cameras were only capable of 10,000. Maitani was once again pushing the boundaries of what was possible in camera manufacturing.
<br>
<br>
M: <i> "The basic concept is "From the Cosmos to Bacteria". To develop a huge system is the first priority. The second is, as what I said before, to overcome the 3 defects of SLRs."</i>
<br>
<br>
Over the next four years the team would tirelessly work to shave millimeters off of their design. By repositioning critical functions, such as the shutter speed selector, they were able to utilize as-yet underutilized space within the traditional SLR chassis. Even as sectors of the design team begged Maitani for an extra three millimeters here, an extra millimeter there, he stayed firm in his demands. When called into a special meeting with the man Maitani called “the godfather of development” regarding the difficulties of miniaturization, Maitani argued for more than two hours that the dimensions must not be changed. In the end, the final production camera was just one millimeter larger than his original dimensions.
<br>
<br>
<center><strong><i>“The Olympus M-1"</i></strong></center>
<br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62988081/132525537-576e00f0-b399-4c63-b9b3-d438be31cf00.jpeg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
<br>
<br>
Unveiled at Photokina in 1972, the Olympus M-1 was named in honor of its chief designer (M for Maitani), and it was a true leap forward in SLR camera design. Suddenly Olympus was making a superbly specced camera that weighed half of what Nikon’s system camera weighed. It was a gorgeous machine with an incredible viewfinder, large controls, and a tiny footprint. It was a camera capable of anything any photographer could ask of it, as evidenced by the many OMs found in conflict zones and laboratories, newspaper pressrooms and travelers’ backpacks, backyards and birthday parties all over the world.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Maitani and Olympus had made another masterpiece, and again changed the course of camera production in the 20th century. From then on, the race to build ever-smaller, ever-more-capable SLRs was on.
<br>
<br>
While development of the OM series, its accessories and lenses kept Maitani busy for years to come, he had another machine on his mind. Maitani wanted to develop an impossibly small, high quality camera that could be carried into any situation. At that point in time, such a camera didn’t exist. In the early days of practical training at the factory, Maitani thought that his Leica IIIf was too large to carry everywhere he went.
<br>
<br>
From a Maitani lecture:
<br>
<br>
M: <i> “When I was doing my factory training, I spent two years at our plant in Suwa. Suwa is a spa town, and there was a public spa next to my lodgings. In winter the place was so cold that towels would freeze solid, with the temperature reaching minus 23 degrees Celsius. Even with my window and sliding doors closed, the temperature in my room would also drop to minus 23, and a vase that my mother had sent me from Shikoku shattered when the water in it froze. 
  <br>
  <br>
   Because it was so cold, the public spa was a popular playground for children. They would call in on their way home from school, and the water always became very dirty. So instead of taking a bath after work, I used to go in the morning before work.

On one such morning the driver of a long-distance truck decided to take a bath while passing through the spa town. He parked his truck in front of the public spa and went in just as I was finishing my bath. 
<br>
<br>
As I left I could hear a strange crackling noise. Sparks from the engine had started a fire, and because it was a gasoline-fueled vehicle the flames spread quickly. The driver came running out stark naked, but it was already too late. There was no water, so we couldn’t fight the fire. It was a once-in-a-lifetime moment, but of course nobody takes their camera to the bath, so unfortunately I missed the opportunity.”</i>
<br>
<br>

Maitani’s desire to have a camera with him wherever he went coupled with the industry trend toward smaller and lighter cameras to push the man into action. Busy with the production of the OM system’s many components, he instructed a design team of ten to come up with ideas for a compact 35mm camera that would recapture the success enjoyed by the compact Pen twenty years earlier. After a year's work, his team presented one hundred ideas to Maitani. He told them this was too many. They settled down to ten ideas, and he again told them it was too many. Then they presented their three best ideas - he was thankful but disappointed. Their proposed cameras were too in-line with established wisdom and too similar to existing machines from other manufacturers while being to large.
<br>
<br>
He wanted to once again push the very possibility of how compact camera could be. Also it should be marketed towards male and female photographers who look for very different things when buying a camera. 
<br>
<br>
M: <i> "You ask about functions only. Why don’t you ask about operation (smiling)? How to memorize exposure value? How to cancel exposure value? … I lay down a principle of development. For example, "miniaturize the camera size but never the size of its button for easy handling". But a principle involves difficulties. It was told "it is impossible" by co-workers or it increases the cost of development."</i>
<br>
<br>
With this idea in mind, he took the project lead and designed a camera himself, at first out of clay.

The result was a machine that many people call the man’s masterpiece. This new camera would be the ultimate embodiment of everything Maitani treasured; a high performance Zuiko lens mounted in an impossibly tiny but incredibly advanced camera. After another period of intense design and prototyping, the camera was born;
<br>
<br>
<center><strong><i>“The Olympus XA"</i></strong></center>

<br>
<br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62988081/132527536-5948c251-fbae-47ef-8578-a62cd1c7cc90.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
<br>
<br>
Released in 1979, the XA was a reckoning, and though many of its design elements seem obvious today, at the time of its release it was like nothing anyone had seen before.
<br>
<br>
People lose their lens-caps all the time. With a sliding plastic lens cover that acted as an On/Off switch, a highly advanced light meter coupled to an aperture-priority auto-exposure system, and an incredibly precise and fast rangefinder focusing system, the XA was a game-changer. It was the smallest 35mm full frame rangefinder camera ever made, and easily fit Maitani’s design requirement that his newest camera should fit in a shirt pocket. The outside was designed to speak to female photographers while the inside was filled with gadgets - the male photographers dream come true.
<br>
<br>
More impressive, the camera’s six-elements in five-groups 35mm F/2.8 lens was simply unmatched in compact cameras, and even today, images from this lens are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/olympusxa/">mind-blowing</a>. And more than 40 years after the camera’s original release, the Olympus XA is still treasured by photo geeks everywhere - also I use it as a daily driver.
<br>
<br>
Where I go, the XA goes. Truly a camera with everything you in the palm of your hand.
<br>
<br>
<center><strong><i>"1984 is now!"</i></strong></center>
<br>
<br>
When the team around Maitani released the OM-4Ti in 1984 nothing quite like it was on the market. It still had the size of the original OM-1 but included the most sophisticated metering system to that day. OTF, or, off-the-film metering meant that light was measured through lens, but just in the exact moment the mirror exposed the film plane to it. Professional photographers around the world would praise the OM-4Ti for the perfectly exposed Kodachromes it produced. It also included the another world's first: In-Camera Multi-Spot Metering.
<br>
<br>
M: <i> "That is a very difficult question (smiling)! Direct light measuring is a center-weighted average system. It is enough for general use. But we have received many kinds of subtle requests for light metering, highlight, shadow and so on. If I remember correctly, Nikon solves this by using Multi-Pattern light metering. …. We have considered a system like that. We examined what is ideal. Basically, I think more than 80% users are satisfied with center-weighted light measuring. But 10 or 20% users want more (smiling). Multi-Pattern metering is one of the solutions. But I doubt it is a good answer."</i>
<br>
<br>
<center><strong><i>Where is the OM-5?</i></strong></center>
<br>
<br> 
M: <i>"The OM System still keeps its concept now. I think it is hard to keep but it works well. It is not the 5. It is more advanced…including everything from OM-1 to now. It is completed in my mind. People find fault with one little thing, with only one function. I want to suggest the camera from another point of view. It is a great dream but it is still not realized."</i>
<br>
<br>
<center><strong><i>"The end is nigh."</i></strong></center>
<br>
<br>
In 2002 Maitani answered the following question to the 30th anniversary of the OM Line: 
<i> "The M-1 was released in 1972. This year is the 30th anniversary of the OM series. Some fans are expecting an anniversary model or a reproduction of the 40mm F2 lens...."</i>
<br>
<br>
M: <i> "On the contrary, the 30th year becomes the last year. Thanks to the long support of OM fans, the OM System was able to continue for 30 years, so I am now full of gratefulness while owing many apologies to the fans. The OM development policy is "From the Cosmos to Bacteria", which means you can take a picture with it anytime, anywhere. The system is enormous and it may be impossible for one to get all the units at once, so we progressed without changing the lens mount so that the users can add an item when it becomes necessary. But they are going to be unavailable...."</i>
<br>
<br>
When the market went digital Olympus had been developing digital cameras most eagerly. Maitani found the replacement of film with digital a desirable tendency. Olympus had been investing billions of yen into plants and equipment for the OM System. It had a capacity of around 65 thousand cameras per month. However, in the last years only several hundreds of cameras a month were made. The machnies would only run for 30 minutes in 30 days and became idle for the rest of the time. The automatic press machine for making the top body cover was as alrge as five meeting rooms. Also, the cloth shutter curtains were woven with a large full-automatic assembling machine. Anyone can guess that it's hard to maintain such large machines without running them. This all happened in contrast to today's usual way of outsourcing.
<br>
<br>
M: <i>"Yes. In those days, Japan was economically highly growing. Then we could lower the production cost by running the plant at full speed. About sixty to seventy thousand cameras were produced per month. Now I regret that if we had hand-made industry line like the Leitz, we might be able to continue. We give up simply because we cannot maintain the big plant."</i>
<br>
<br>
With the rebirth of the film community the talk about Maitanis children, the exceptionally high-performance lenses of the OM System became the stuff of legends. I have yet to hold the 50mm F2 Auto-Macro in my hands. It is one of the unspoken gems from the whole OM line up of lenses. While experienced users on the forum say that Zuikos rival Nikons early all-metal "the stuff of legend" glass while being a lot smaller almost every time, the 50mm/f2 Macro behaves like a lens Leitz could have designed. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
The lack of F2 macro lenses in other manufacturer's line-up's of that day empowers the thought of them not being confident in their own abilities.
<br>
<br>
M: <i> "Rather than confidence, I think they should have more tenacity. Now, Japan comes to a standstill. We have to consider everything again from the origin of a high-tech nation to break this deadlock and have the joy and tenacity to make "something necessary and valuable"</i>
<br>
<br>
Nowadays his cameras enjoy a growing community which I personally think would please him to see. He always had the consumer in mind when he designed something so the consumer could concentrate on taking great pictures. For my adventures I want to get a 50/F2 and an OM-4Ti - A set that does exactly what you would expect from it. Everything.
